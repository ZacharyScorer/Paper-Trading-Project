# Paper Trading

This web app allows users to simulate trading stocks using real world data. Users can log in and manage their positions by buying or selling shares.
A money counter tracks the user's net profit. Additionally, users can search for stocks and get their current price along with the day change of the 
stock. On the home page, users can see the top five gainers and losers in the market. Finally, users have access to a private watchlist which they 
can add stocks to for easy access.
